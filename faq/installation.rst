.. _faq-install-conflict:

Does TLP conflict with other power management tools?
----------------------------------------------------
.. important::

    **Generally yes. It is not recommended to use two (or more) power
    management tools at the same time.**

This is because all power management tools essentially control a similar
set of :ref:`kernel tunables <intro-how-it-works>`.
Therefore, TLP's tuning will be overriden by the other tool (and vice versa),
making the actual power savings unpredictable.
The individual tools involved are discussed below.

**auto-cpufreq:** controls a subset of TLP's kernel tunables, do *not* use
together with TLP â€” *Note: auto-cpufreq is not a pure power saving tool.
On the contrary, when the CPU is under heavy load in battery mode, performance
is improved at the cost of higher power consumption.*

**GNOME, KDE Plasma and Cinnamon desktops:** usually include `power-profiles-daemon`, see below.

**Intel Low Power Mode Daemon:** `intel-lpmd <https://github.com/intel/intel-lpmd>`_
is designed to optimize active idle power by activating the power-efficient corest and
disabling the rest. Conflicts with TLP are not known.

**power-profiles-daemon:** check :doc:`/faq/ppd`.

**Powertop:** please refer to :doc:`powertop`.

**Slimbook Battery:** uses TLP as a backend to apply power saving measures.
However, it continuously overwrites your TLP configuration.
If you wish to configure TLP individually, you must first uninstall
Slimbook Battery.

**system76-power:** works on the same set of :ref:`kernel tunables
<intro-how-it-works>` as TLP. Do *not* use together with TLP.

**thermald:** limits power dissipation to prevent the laptop from overheating.
It does not provide power saving functionality for other situations and
therefore does not conflict with TLP.

**throttled:** only throttled's dynamic `HWP_Mode` setting interferes with TLP's
actions. If you want to use it, disable the feature in TLP by configuring
`CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC=""`.

.. _faq-service-units:

Must I enable TLP's systemd service unit?
------------------------------------------
Symptoms: :command:`tlp-stat -s` shows ::

    Error: tlp.service is not enabled, power saving will not apply on boot.
    >>> Invoke 'systemctl enable tlp.service' to correct this!

Answer: *yes*, the service unit is *indispensable* for correct operation -
**tlp.service** applies power saving settings and charge thresholds
as well as switching radio devices on system boot and shutdown.

.. note::

    Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu enable the service by default as part of the
    package :doc:`/installation/index`, others such as Arch Linux don't.
    If unsure check the output of :command:`tlp-stat -s` for corresponding
    notes.

Does TLP run on my laptop (not a ThinkPad)?
-------------------------------------------
TLP runs on every laptop brand. A few features are available on IBM/Lenovo
ThinkPads only.

Does TLP make sense on newer laptops / with newer Linux versions?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, of course.

The Linux kernel has accumulated many power saving features over the years,
but not all are enabled by default. It seems to be really hard for the kernel
developers to fully debug power saving on all possible hardware, so power
saving stays disabled for many drivers and it's up to the user to enable it.

Conclusion: a userspace tool like TLP is still needed to enable power saving globally.

Should I install TLP inside a virtual machine?
----------------------------------------------
No. It is not effective to run a power management tool inside a virtual machine
guest. Install TLP in the host operating system instead.

Ubuntu/Debian: I do not use Network Manager, how do I install tlp without tlp-rdw?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
::

    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends tlp

Ubuntu: How do I prevent the installation of postfix as a dependency?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The package `tlp` recommends `smartmontools` which pulls `postfix`
(via recommends too). Use: ::

    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends tlp tlp-rdw ethtool smartmontools


My Linux distribution does not provide a TLP package, how do I install it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
See :doc:`/installation/others`.

How do I install TLP on a development release of my distribution?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
TLP packages for new distribution versions appear in due time for the release.
If you want to use TLP with alpha or beta releases, download the packages for
the predecessor and install them manually with your favorite package manager.


What if I want a GUI?
---------------------
Get `TLPUI <https://github.com/d4nj1/TLPUI>`_.
